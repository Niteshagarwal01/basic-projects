# Drag and Drop Demo

Short description

A demonstration of HTML5 drag-and-drop APIs. Shows dragging items between containers, reordering, or dropping files/elements.

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — drag and drop handlers
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser. For file-drop demos that use File APIs, a modern browser is recommended.

Notes

- Behavior varies slightly between browsers; test in Chrome/Edge/Firefox for consistency.
