# Bookmark Saver

Short description

A small app to save, list, and remove bookmarks locally. Good as an example of form handling and simple persistence (usually `localStorage`).

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — bookmark logic
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a static server.

Notes

- No server-side storage by default. Add a backend or sync to cloud storage to persist across devices.
