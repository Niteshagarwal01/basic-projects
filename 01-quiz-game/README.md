# Quiz Game

Short description

This is a simple multiple-choice quiz game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It demonstrates DOM updates, handling user input, and basic game flow (questions, scoring, next question).

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — quiz logic
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Or serve the project folder with a static server (see top-level README for examples).

Notes

- Data (questions) are typically stored in `script.js`. You can extend the question set or load from a JSON file for more flexibility.
