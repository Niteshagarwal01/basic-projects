# Recipe Finder

Short description

A recipe search UI that may demonstrate fetching recipes from a public API. Depending on the implementation, you might need an API key.

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — search and fetch logic
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser. If the app uses a remote API, run it via a local server to avoid CORS issues and check `script.js` for API configuration and keys.

Notes

- If an API key is required, store it securely and don't commit secrets to the repo. For local testing, you can proxy requests or use environment-backed serverless functions.
