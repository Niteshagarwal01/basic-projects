# Expense Tracker

Short description

A minimal expense tracker that demonstrates adding entries, removing them, and calculating totals. Typically persists data to `localStorage`.

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — app logic
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local static server.

Notes

- Check `script.js` to see if data persistence uses `localStorage`. You can adapt the persistence layer to use an API/backend if needed.
