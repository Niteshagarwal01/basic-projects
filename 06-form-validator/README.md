# Form Validator

Short description

A set of client-side form validation examples and patterns. Useful to learn about input validation, feedback messages, and constraint checks.

Files

- `index.html` — entry point
- `script.js` — validation logic
- `style.css` — styles

How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser.

Notes

- Client-side validation improves UX but should be paired with server-side validation for security.
